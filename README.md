My Dropbox e-Library
Last update: 2014-02-02
=========================

Simple Android App that use Dropbox as a library for e-books (e-Library)

TO DO IMPROVEMENTS/NEW FEATURES:
- Error checking of several parts of the App
- Check if the user is connected to Internet when the App is opened
- Download the list of ebooks (metadata: title, author, cover...) 
to the device (cach√©) in order to improve the performance and 
the loading time of the list. Synchronize the local list with Dropbox
in order to detect changes.
- Test performance and optimize algorithms if ti's posible
- Detect folders with ebooks and no list them
- Fix some bugs:
  * When the list of ebooks is sorted by date, the icons are not well assigned
